# SPARQL Query to Retrieve Nodes and Their Relationships from the Knowledge Graph
# This query selects nodes (subjects) and their relationships (predicates) to other nodes (objects).

PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/schema#>  # Define a namespace for the example schema

SELECT ?subject ?predicate ?object
WHERE {
  ?subject ?predicate ?object .
  # Optional: Filter to include only specific types of entities
  # Uncomment the next line to filter for a specific type, e.g., Person
  # ?subject rdf:type ex:Person .

  # Example filter to exclude blank nodes (useful for data quality management)
  FILTER(isIRI(?subject) && isIRI(?object))
}
LIMIT 100  # Limit the number of results for quick inspection
